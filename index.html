			<h1>Portugal</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Castles, cathedrals, cobblestone streets, Fado, beautiful and hidden beaches, volcanic islands, fresh fish, great wine.... I found surprising, new, and wonderful things in each area I visited: Lisbon, Cascais, Madeira, and yes, even the sellout Algarves.</p>

			<h1>Caye Caulker, Belize</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Ever since Jeff first visited Caye Caulker off the coast of Belize, he has kept coming back. Divers come from around the world to dive the Blue Hole, and, for snorkelers, tours along "Shark Alley" on the coral reef are amazing.</p>

			<p>Joel went to Europe for the first time in 2015 and did a three-week tour of Italy.  He visited: Florence, Pompeii, Cinque-Terre, Rome, and so many other amazing towns.  Then he went to Costa Rica in 2016 to experience a completely different side of the world.</p>

			<h1>Bora Bora</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Stephanie has always wanted to visit Bora Bora. You've probably seen pictures of Bora Bora on iconic vacation posters with thatch-hut houses floating on stilts above crystal clear, blue water.... Apparently it's pretty hard to get there, but it sounds pretty magical.</p>
