# BlogExperiment

This is a basic blog page that has 5 articles and includes:

- a page header containing the blog's title
- a page footer containing the copyright notice
- Each article has a header containing a title.
- Each article has a footer containing the author and publication date.
- Each article has at least one section.

Then, to style the page, for each article, the following 7 things need to be unique:

- background color
- font family
- font size
- font color
- line height
- padding
- border with rounded corners of different sizes (e.g. one article could have barely rounded borders, but the next one could be almost circular in shape)
